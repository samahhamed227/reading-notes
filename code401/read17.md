# Read : 17 AWS : S3 and Lambda

### Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. Describe “The Cloud”**

Refers to services that are accessed over the internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers [cloudfare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)

**2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

**3. What is auto-scaling?**

Autoscaling, also spelled auto scaling or auto-scaling, and sometimes also called automatic scaling, is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling)

**4. What is bandwidth?**

In computing, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))

**4. How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

Network hardware costs, infrastructure maintenances, labor, hardware operation, hardware acquisition [Joe Palian - expedient](https://expedient.com/knowledgebase/blog/2015-05-01-how-the-cost-of-cloud-computing-is-calculated/)

**Term** | **Definition**
-----|-----
Server Instances | A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. [techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance)
Containers | A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
Cloud Services | On-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
Cloud Architecture | Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile ),back end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network (Internet, Intranet, Intercloud). Combined, these components make up cloud computing architecture. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_architecture)
AWS | Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services)
EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku | Price ways, Beanstalk is better for large scale ongoing projects, and Heroku is better for small projects
