## Introduction
To get the most out of this book, you will need to know how to bui ld web pages using HTML
and CSS. Beyond that. no prior experience with programming is necessary. Learning to
program with JavaScript involves:

1. Understanding some basic programming concepts and
the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.

2.Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary
and how to structure your sentences.
 
 3. Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at
examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.


- The only equipment you need to use this book are a computer with a modern web browser
installed, and your favorite code editor, (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit. Sublime Text. or Coda)


#### How js makes webpages more interactive
 1. ACCESS CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of email.
  
  2. MODIFY CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element
  
  3.PROGRAM RULES:  You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).  
  
  4.REACT TO EVENTS: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading

  # what is ascript and how do i creat one?
 * A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. 
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 

 *To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 
  
  
## How do computers fit in with the wor ld around them ?
  * computer create models of the worls using data 
  * the models use objects to represent physical things.
  objects can have properties thaaat tell us about the object ;methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; events ehich are triggered when a user interacts with the computer
  * programmers can write code to say "when this event occurs ,run that code"
  * web browsers use HTML markup to crate a model of the web page each element creates its own node(which is kind of object)
  -to make web pages interactive , you write code that uses the browsers model of the web page 
  
  ## how Do I write script the webpages
  
 * It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript 
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and 
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like 
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.
