## How to make your wireframe in six steps
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing

How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles

# HTML
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 

# The main parts of our element are as follows:

1. The opening tag: <>  
2. The closing tag:</>
3. The content: This is the content of the element, 
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.






## html
HTML uses " markup " to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
HTML markup includes special "elements" such as < head >, < title >, 

#  An attribute should always have the following:

### 1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
### 2.  The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
### 3.The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
    
    
    # Semantics
### In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

# Semantics in JavaScript
### In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

# Semantics in CSS
### In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

# Semantics in HTML
### In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
