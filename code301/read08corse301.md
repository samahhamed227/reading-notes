## **API Design Best Practices**

### ***What does REST stand for?***

- It's referse to `Roy Fielding proposed Representational State Transfer`,and it's an architectural approach to designing web services,which considered a style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia.

### ***REST APIs are designed around a ____.***

-  `Resources`, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.`Resource has an identifier`.

### ***What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.***

- It's URI that uniquely identifies that resource.

>Example:

- **HTTP**
   - https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

### ***What are the most common HTTP verbs?***

- The most common operations are `GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE`.


### ***What should the URIs be based on?***


- The `URIs` should be based on `nouns` the resource and not `verbs` the operations on the resource.

### ***Give an example of a good URI.***

>Example:
- https://adventure-works.com/orders 

### ***What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?***

- That's means the web `APIs` that expose a large number of small resources.And it's a bad thing we should try to avoid `chatty web APIs`.

### ***What status code does a successful `GET` request return?***

- It's  returns `HTTP` status code `200 (OK)`.

### ***What status code does an unsuccessful `GET` request return?***


- It's return `404 (Not Found)`.

### ***What status code does a successful `POST` request return?***

- It's return `HTTP` status code `200`.

### ***What status code does a successful `DELETE` request return?***

- It's  respond with `HTTP` status code `204`.
