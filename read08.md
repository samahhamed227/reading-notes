# CSS page layout :
techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.  The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are

- Normal flow
- The display property
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Floats
- Positioning
- Table layout
- Multiple-column layout
Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each method is designed for you will be in a good place to understand which is the best layout tool for each task.

# Normal flow
Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.

# The display property
The main methods of achieving page layout in CSS are all values of the display property. This property allows us to change the default way something displays. 

# Flexbox
Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout Module, designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension — either as a row or as a column.

# Grid Layout
While flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, Grid Layout is designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.

# Floats
Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow. The element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content floats around the floated item.


# The float property has four possible values:

- left — Floats the element to the left.
- right — Floats the element to the right.
- none — Specifies no floating at all. This is the default value.
- inherit — Specifies that the value of the float property should be inherited from the element's parent element.



# Positioning techniques
Positioning allows you to move an element from where it would be placed when in normal flow to another location. Positioning isn’t a method for creating your main page layouts, it is more about managing and fine-tuning the position of specific items on the page.


# Static positioning is
 the default that every element gets — it just means "put the element into its normal position in the document layout flow — nothing special to see here".
# Relative positioning 
allows you to modify an element's position on the page, moving it relative to its position in normal flow — including making it overlap other elements on the page.
# Absolute positioning
 moves an element completely out of the page's normal layout flow, like it is sitting on its own separate layer.

 # Fixed positioning is
  very similar to absolute positioning, except that it fixes an element relative to the browser viewport, not another element. 

  # Sticky positioning is
   a newer positioning method which makes an element
