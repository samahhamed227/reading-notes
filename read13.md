# Local Storage

*  Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
* Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

# What we really want is

a lot of storage space
on the client
that persists beyond a page refresh
and isn’t transmitted to the server

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5
In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, that’s what Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the First Great Browser Wars, Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. One of these things was called DHTML Behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called userData.

# INTRODUCING HTML5 STORAGE
What I will refer to as “HTML5 Storage” is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.” The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named, emerging standards that I’ll discuss later in this chapter.

# USING HTML5 STORAGE
HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.


# TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA
If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something. For example, if you set an item to its existing value or call clear() when there are no named keys, the storage event will not fire, because nothing actually changed in the storage area.

# LIMITATIONS IN CURRENT BROWSERS
In talking about the history of local storage hacks using third-party plugins, I made a point of mentioning the limitations of each technique, such as storage limits. I just realized that I haven’t mentioned anything about the limitations of the now-standardized HTML5 Storage. I’ll give you the answers first, then explain them. The answers, in order of importance, are “5 megabytes,” “QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR,” and “no.”

# HTML5 STORAGE IN ACTION
Let’s see HTML5 Storage in action. Recall the Halma game we constructed in the canvas chapter. There’s a small problem with the game: if you close the browser window mid-game, you’ll lose your progress. But with HTML5 Storage, we can save the progress locally, within the browser itself. Here is a live demonstration. Make a few moves, then close the browser tab, then re-open it. If your browser supports HTML5 Storage, the demonstration page should magically remember your exact position within the game, including the number of moves you’ve made, the position of each of the pieces on the board, and even whether a particular piece is selected.

# BEYOND NAMED KEY-VALUE PAIRS: COMPETING VISIONS
While the past is littered with hacks and workarounds, the present condition of HTML5 Storage is surprisingly rosy. A new API has been standardized and implemented across all major browsers, platforms, and devices. As a web developer, that’s just not something you see every day, is it? But there is more to life than “5 megabytes of named key/value pairs,” and the future of persistent local storage is… how shall I put it… well, there are competing visions.
