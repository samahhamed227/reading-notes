# Forms
* The HTML <.form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input
* The <form.> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

* The HTML <input.> element is the most used form element.

* An <input. > element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute.

### The <label.> Element
Notice the use of the <label> element in the example above.

The <label.> tag defines a label for many form elements.

The <labe.l> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The <label.> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label.> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label.> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input.> element to bind them together.

# type of input :
1. Radio Buttons
2. checkbox
3. password
4. button
5. textarea

- in addition to the CSS properties covered in other 
chapters which work with the contents of all elements, 
there are several others that are specifically used to 
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
* List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.
* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in 
different browsers, but there are properties you can 
use to control them and make them more consistent. 
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.
* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive

# HTML Events
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

# What can JavaScript Do?
Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

1. Things that should be done every time a page loads
2. Things that should be done when the page is closed
3. Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
4. Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
And more ...
5. Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

6. HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
7. HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
8. You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
9. You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
And more ...
