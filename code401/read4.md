#  Data Modeling

# 1- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

###### 1- Better program design and higher code quality
###### 2- TDD reduces the time required for project development
###### 3- Detailed project documentation

# 2- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

* If need to setup a mock object or data structure and this object or structure can be reused by all the tests


# 3- What is one downside of Test Driven Development***

-  `TDD` is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. Whenever requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests.And when writing code that apparently takes an extended time.

# 4- Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

**In ES6, the "class" keyword and associated features are a new approach to creating prototype constructors. They are not true classes in a way that would be familiar to users of most other object-oriented languages.**
**The constructor property returns a reference to the Object constructor function that created the instance object. Note that the value of this property is a reference to the function itself, not a string containing the function's name.**


# 5- Why REST?

its like creating knowledge of actions that happened before the client made the request and what will or should happen after the response is sent back to the client. REST is used when you are talking to your API.



### **Document the following Vocabulary Terms**

- **functional programming**: Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions. 
- **object-oriented programming `OOP`**: is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 
- **class**:  is a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes.
- **super**: The `super` keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
- **this**: The JavaScript `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
- **Test Driven Development `TDD`**: is to simply start working on code by writing automated tests BEFORE writing the code that is being tested.
- **Jest**: is an open-source testing framework built on JavaScript, designed majorly to work with React and React Native based web applications.
- **Continuous Integration `CI`**: is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
- **REST**: `REpresentational State Transfer (REST)` is an architectural style that handles the client-server relationship, with the purpose of aiming for speed and performance by using re-usable components.
- **Data Model**: an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities
