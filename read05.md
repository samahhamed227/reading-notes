# <img.> 
To add an image into the page 
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty 
element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes:

![img](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR9i2zplrvFk_h_69ktwMciJiUrg_H7aNSG5w&usqp=CAU)

The <img> tag has an attributes:
# src
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site. 

# alt
This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.

# title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <img.> element 
to provide additional information 
about the image. Most browsers 
will display the content of this 
attribute in a tootip when the 
user hovers over the image.

# height
This specifies the height of the 
image in pixels.
# width
This specifies the width of the 
image in pixels


# align 
The align attribute was 
commonly used to indicate how 
the other parts of a page should 
flow around an image. 
1. left
2. right
3. top
4. middle
5. bottom

# Three Rules for Creating Images
1. Save images in 
the right format
Websites mainly use images in 
jpeg, gif, or png format.

2. Save images at the right size
You should save the image at 
the same width and height it will 
appear on the website.

3. Use the correct resolution
Computer screens are made up 
of dots known as pixels.saving images at 
a higher resolution results in 
images that are larger than 
necessary and take longer to

# Definition and Usage
The <figcaption.> tag defines a caption for a <figure.> element.

The <figcaption.> element can be placed as the first or last child of the <figure.> element.

# Foreground Color
![forground](https://www.pantone.com/media/aw_rbslider/slides/pantone-lifestyle-pride-homepage.jpg)
 The color property allows you 
to specify the color of text inside 
an element. You can specify any 
color in CSS in one of three ways:
# rgb values
These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90)
 # hex codes
These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80
# color names
There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan.
# background-color

You can specify your choice of 
background color in the same 
three ways you can specify 
foreground colors: RGB values, 
hex codes, and color names 
(covered on the next page).
If you do not specify a 
background color, then the 
background is transparent


# opacity, rgba
CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to 
specify the opacity of an element 
and any of its child elements. 
The value is a number between 
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% 
opacity).

# hsl, hsla

The hsl color property has 
been introduced in CSS3 as an 
alternative way to specify colors. 
The value of the property starts 
with the letters hsl, followed 
by individual values inside 
parentheses for:
## hue
This is expressed as an angle 
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
## saturation
This is expressed as a 
percentage.
## lightness
This is expressed as a 
percentage with 0% being white, 
50% being normal, and 100% 
being black.
 
 ## alpha
This is expressed as a 
number between 0 and 1.0. 
For example, 0.5 represents 
50% transparency, and 0.75
represents 75% transparency.

# choosing a typeface
![image of font](https://zeichenschatz.net/uploads/2020/12/different-display-typefaces-show-different-feelings.png)
1. Serif
Serif fonts have extra details on 
the end of the main strokes of 
the letters.

2. Sans-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight 
ends to letters and therefore 
have a much cleaner design


3. Monospace
Every letter in a monospace 
typeface is the same width. 
(Non-monospace fonts have 
different widths.)

4. Cursive fonts either have 
joining strokes or other cursive 
characteristics, such as 
handwriting styles.

5. Fantasy
Fantasy fonts are usually 
decorative fonts and are often 
used for titles. They're not 
designed for long bodies of text.

# text-transform
1. uppercase

2. underline
3. overline
4. line-through
5. blink

# line-height
Leading (pronounced ledding) is 
a term typographers use for the 
vertical space between lines of 
text. In a typeface, the part of 
a letter that drops beneath the 
baseline is called a descender, 
while the highest point of a letter 
is called the ascender. Leading 
is measured from the bottom of 
the descender on one line to the 
top of the ascender on the next.

# text-align

# text-indent
The text-indent property 
allows you to indent the first 
line of text within an element. 
# text-shadow
The text-shadow property has 
become commonly used despite 
lacking support in all browsers. 

# :first-letter,:first-line
Technically these are not 
properties. They are known as 
pseudo-elements.
You specify the pseudo-element 
at the end of the selector, and 
then specify the declarations as 
you would normally for any other 
element.

# :link
This allows you to set styles 
for links that have not yet been 
visited. 
# :visited
This allows you to set styles for 
links that have been clicked on.
# :hover
This is applied when a user 
hovers over an element with a 
pointing device such as a mouse. 

# :active
This is applied when an element 
is being activated by a user; for 
example, when a button is being 
pressed or a link being clicked. 
# :focus
This is applied when an element 
has focus. Any element that 
you can interact with, such as a 
link you can click on or any form 
control can have focus.


# TL;DR
Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
