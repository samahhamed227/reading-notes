# images
The <img.> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img.> tag has two required attributes:

* src - Specifies the path to the image
* alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

#### Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.

# vedio & audio
 ## HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — <video.> and <audio.> — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. This article shows you how to do common tasks such as creating custom playback controls.

## The whole player is wrapped in a <div> element, so it can all be styled as one unit if needed.
The <video.> element contains two <source> elements so that different formats can be loaded depending on the browser viewing the site.

# Practical Information
 1. Page Title The page title appears at the top 
of the browser window or on the  tab of a browser. It is specified in 
the <title.> element which lives  inside the <head.> element.
2. URL / Web Address The name of the file is part of 
the URL. Where possible, use  keywords in the file name.
3. Headings
If the keywords are in a heading <hn.> element then a search 
engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it 
greater weight than other text.
4. Text
Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main 
body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do not, however, over-use 
these terms, because the text must be easy for a human to 
read.
5. Link Text Use keywords in the text that 
create links between pages (rather than using generic 
expressions such as "click here").
6. Image Alt Text Search engines rely on you 
providing accurate descriptions  of images in the alt text. This 
will also help your images show  up in the results of image-based 
searches.
7. Page Descriptions
The description also lives inside  the <head0.> element and is 
specified using a <meta.> tag. It should be a sentence that 
describes the content of the page. (These are not shown in 
the browser window but they  may be displayed in the results 
pages of search engines.)
Never try to fool search engines! They will penalize you for it. For 
example, never add text in the same color as the background of 
the page as they can detect this

* Search engine optimization helps visitors find your 
sites when using search engines.
- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to 
see how many people visit your site, how they find it, 
and what they do when they get there.
* To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a 
domain name and web hosting.
* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your 
local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email 
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website 
tools (to save you writing them from scratch)
