# Headings and paragraphs: 
HTML has six "levels" of 
headings:
<h1>h1 is used for main headings
<h2>h2 level 2 heading
<h3> h3 level 3 heading
<h4> h4 level 4 heading
<h5> h5 level5 heading
<h6> h6 level 6heading


# paragraph
<p>
To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag

</br>
<h3>

 # Bold, italic, emphasis
By enclosing words in the tags 
<b> <  b  >and </b> <   / b>  we can make 
characters appear bold 
</br>

By enclosing words in the tags 
< i > and </ i> we can make 
characters appear italic.

</br>

The < sup> element is used 
to contain characters that 
should be superscript such 
as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts like 
raising a number to a power such 
as 22
.
</br>


< sub>
The <sub> element is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas such as H2
0.

</br>

The use of the <  strong>
element indicates that its 
content has strong importance. 
For example, the words 
contained in this element might 
be said with strong emphasis.

 - HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)

1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
2. Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).
3. Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.
4. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
5.  CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page


- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
- Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


1. Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 
Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands. 
2. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one 
set of comparison operators. 
3. if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
4. switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match). 
5. Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
6. All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
7. There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
