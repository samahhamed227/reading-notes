# Backface Visibility
When working with three-dimensional transforms, elements will occasionally be transformed in a way that causes them to face away from the screen. This may be caused by setting the rotateY(180deg) value for example. By default these elements are shown from the back. So if you prefer not to see these elements at all, set the backface-visibility property to hidden, and you will hide the element whenever it is facing away from the screen.


# 3D Translate
Elements may also be translated on the z axis using the translateZ value. A negative value here will push an element further away on the z axis, resulting in a smaller element. Using a positive value will pull an element closer on the z axis, resulting in a larger element.

# 2D Translate
The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.

# Transitions
As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

# Animation Direction
On top of being able to set the number of times an animation repeats, you may also declare the direction an animation completes using the animation-direction property. Values for the animation-direction property include normal, reverse, alternate, and alternate-reverse.

# CSS3 has introduced countless possibilities for UX designers, and the best thing about them is that the coolest parts are really simple to implement.

Just a couple of lines of code will give you an awesome transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions. Whatâ€™s more, these effects are hardware accelerated, and a progressive enhancement that you can use right now.
