# Introduction 
## The Structure of This Book: 

- In order to teach you about creating web pages,
this book is divided into three sections:

1.HTML
We will spend the first chapter
looking at how HTML is used to
create web pages.

2. CSS
We start this section with a
chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages.

3.Practical
We end up with some helpful
information that will assist you in
building better websites.

# How People Access the Web
Before we look at the code used to build
websites it is important to consider the
different ways in which people access the web
and clarify some terminology.

1. Browsers
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.

2.Web Servers
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.

3.Screen readers
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

4. Devices
People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones. 

# How Websites Are Created

1. What you see :
When you are looking at a
website, it is most likely that
your browser will be receiving
HTML and CSS from the web
server that hosts the site.

2. How it is Created
Small websites are often written
just using HTML and CSS.

3. HTML5 & CSS3
Since the web was first created
there have been several versions
of HTML and CSS — each
intended to be an improvement
on the previous version. 

## 
When you visit a website, the web server
 hosting that site could be anywhere in the
 world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

1. When you connect to the web,
you do so via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). You type a
domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site;
for example: google.com,
bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.

2. Your computer contacts a
network of servers called
Domain Name System (DNS)
servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer
the IP address associated with
the requested domain name.

3. The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a
computer that is constantly
connected to the web, and is set
up especially to send web pages
to users.

4. The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.

# HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” 

## How Pages Use Structure

* Think about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long
piece, there may be subheadings
that split the story into separate
sections or quotes from those
involved. Structure helps readers
understand the stories in the
newspaper.

* The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is
illustrated on the right with a
copy of a newspaper alongside
the corresponding article on its
website.

* Now think about a very different
type of document — an
insurance form. Insurance forms
often have headings for different
sections, and each section
contains a list of questions with
areas for you to fill in details or
checkboxes to tick. Again, the
structure is very similar online.

### Structuring Word Documents
he use of headings and subheadings in any document
often reflects a hierarchy of information. 
- For example, a
document might start with
a large heading, followed by
an introduction or the most
important information.

- This might be expanded upon
under subheadings lower down on the page. 
On the right, you can see a simple document in Microsoft
Word.
- The different styles for the document, such as different
levels of heading, are shown in the drop down box. If you
regularly use Word, you might have also used the formatting
toolbar or palette to do this.



## HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
##### <HTML>
##### <body>
#### <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
####  <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
##### </body>
##### </HTML>

- Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.
Description
The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
</body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.
The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.
The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.
Attributes Tell Us
More About Elements
<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
Attribute
Name
Attribute
Value

## Summary STRUCTURE
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” 

### Summary EXTRA MARKUP
-  DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
 - <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

# HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” 

 ## Summary HTML5 LAYOUT
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

# HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” 

### Summary PROCESS & Design
- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.


## Introduction js
To get the most out of this book, you will need to know how to bui ld web pages using HTML
and CSS. Beyond that. no prior experience with programming is necessary. Learning to
program with JavaScript involves:

1. Understanding some basic programming concepts and
the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.

2.Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary
and how to structure your sentences.
 
 3. Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at
examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.


- The only equipment you need to use this book are a computer with a modern web browser
installed, and your favorite code editor, (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit. Sublime Text. or Coda)


#### How js makes webpages more interactive
 1. ACCESS CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of email.
  
  2. MODIFY CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element
  
  3.PROGRAM RULES:  You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).  
  
  4.REACT TO EVENTS: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading

  # what is ascript and how do i creat one?
 * A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. 
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 

 *To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 
  
  
## How do computers fit in with the wor ld around them ?
  * computer create models of the worls using data 
  * the models use objects to represent physical things.
  objects can have properties thaaat tell us about the object ;methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; events ehich are triggered when a user interacts with the computer
  * programmers can write code to say "when this event occurs ,run that code"
  * web browsers use HTML markup to crate a model of the web page each element creates its own node(which is kind of object)
  -to make web pages interactive , you write code that uses the browsers model of the web page 
  
  ## how Do I write script the webpages
  
 * It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript 
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and 
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like 
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.
