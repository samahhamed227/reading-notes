# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. **Greater efficiency**
2. **Engaged collaboration**
3. **Learning from fellow students**
4. **Social skills**
5. **Job interview readiness**
6. **Work environment readiness**

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
Social skills
Learning from fellow students

## How does pair programming work?
pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.

The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code


 ### *** In your experience, which of these reasons did you find the most useful? ***

For me, I see that the biggest benefit of pair programming is the missionary's efficiency, co-operation, and learning from fellow students that we all think about together and that adds up to new things to pick up from each other. It makes work more fun and exciting.

### *** How does pair programming work? ***

- It's work by two programmers working together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes the code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of the code as it is written. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
