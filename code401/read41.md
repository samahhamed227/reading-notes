    - Redux is the core state management library

    - Redux Toolkit wraps around the Redux core and provides APIs to simplify common Redux use cases

   - React-Redux lets your React components talk to a Redux store, however it was created

    - So, you'll be creating your store with Redux Toolkit, and passing the store to React-Redux.

### ***What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit***

- Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

## **Terms**

- **redux toolkit slices**: A function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic.

 
- **namespace**: A namespace component is another feature request that is available in React JSX.

## **React Native**

- React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. In other words: web developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly “native,” all from the comfort of a JavaScript library that we already know and love. Plus, because most of the code you write can be shared between platforms, React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS.
